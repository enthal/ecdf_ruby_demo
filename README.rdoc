Suppose you have multiple large files (on the order of 100GBs) containing tuples of the following form: 

  {user_id, payment_id, payment_amount, is_card_present, created_at}. 

Write a program to compute the empirical cumulative distribution function of the card present ratio 
for users who processed less than $100, and for users who processed over $100.
 
The expected output should be of the form:
 
Users who processed less than $100
percentile    % cp
1             0
2             0
3             5
...           ...
100           100
 
and similarly for users who processed over $100.
